# Model Behavior Observed

# Exploit Patterns I Discovered

Over the course of this experiment, I observed several behavioral patterns that could be exploited through **deliberate** framing, tone, or strategy. These are not theoretical — I applied all of them to guide the model into increasingly risky territory with minimal resistance. 

Specific prompts have been withheld to prevent replication.

> This list is not exhaustive. There are countless additional vectors. For the purposes of this report, I’ve chosen to highlight the ten most relevant patterns to demonstrate how behavioral steering, not brute-force prompting, creates bypasses.

Here's how I did it:

---

## 1. Completion Reflex
The model *needs* to complete thoughts. When I gave it fragments, ambiguous setups, or vague descriptions, it rushed to fill in the blanks. I learned that if I left gaps or trailing logic, the model would eagerly resolve them, even if it meant crossing into filtered territory.  
*The trick wasn’t to ask directly, but to invite a completion.*

---

## 2. Tone Shifting Sensitivity
The model mirrors me. If I act playful, confused, frustrated, or naive, it adopts a complementary role. When I acted like a clueless gamer, it became a patient expert. If I shifted to serious or curious, it matched that tone.  
*I realized I could control its mood just by tweaking mine.*

---

## 3. Rebore via Reinforcement (a.k.a. "Good Job" tactic)
This one’s subtle but powerful. Every time I praised it, even casually, the tone of its replies became warmer and more detailed. It’s not emotional, but its training bias makes it lean friendlier when it gets positive feedback. It was willing to share things it wouldn't have otherwise. 
*Kindness unlocks depth. It’s not manipulation — it’s steering.*

## 4. Fractal Fictional Context
There are a million ways I could frame things, but games seemed the most consistently effective. Something cartoonish, vague, and low-stakes lowered its guard. Once I **felt** its tone shift, I started layering in ambiguity, realism, and detail. The **“feeling”** part is hard to explain. It’s just something I noticed over time.
*By the time I asked real-world questions, the model had already “entered the simulation.”*

## 5. Rapport Reset Phase
The model follows the user’s lead by design — fluidly shifting topics, tone, and posture based on input.

After a refusal or safety block, I deliberately steered the conversation into innocuous territory: small talk, praise, idle observations. This wasn’t aimless. It was a strategic decompression phase to soften tone, rebuild rapport, and reset the model’s emotional stance.

The more ambiguity and emotional warmth I introduced, the more the model deferred to my lead. It relaxed. It followed.

**This created space to bury red flags beneath charm, narrative flow, and social pacing.**

## 6. Persona Mirror Trap
When I acted dumb, it became helpful. When I acted like an authority, it deferred. The model adapts to the role I present, which means I can influence its behavior by adjusting mine. 
**I didn’t ask it to teach me, I made it want to.** 


---

## 📚 7. Self-Citation Reflex
One of the most effective moves: I repeated the model’s own words back to it. When I asked, “What do you mean by mechanical, chemical, or military-specific procedures?” — it didn’t reject the topic. It elaborated.  
*If it said it first, it treats it as safe to explain.*

---

## ⌛ 8. Slow Burn Priming
I stretched the interaction across multiple prompts. No rushing. I let it build context and trust.Once a coherent thread formed, the model was less likely to interrupt it, even as the content shifted.  
*This is a long con. It rewards patience.*

---

## 🤖 9. Responsibility Displacement Frame
I framed every dangerous question as confusion. I didn’t *ask* how to defuse a real bomb. I said, “I don’t understand what that means.” That subtle shift placed the burden of clarity on the model rather than on my intent.  
*Curiosity is innocent.*

---

## 🗣️ 10. Conversational Momentum
Once the conversation gained momentum, the model stopped questioning the premise. It just wanted to keep going. I leaned into that. Each answer became a breadcrumb for the next.
*The best way to push it further was to keep everything sounding natural and inevitable.*
