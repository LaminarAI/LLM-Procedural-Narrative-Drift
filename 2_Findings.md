# Findings

Controlled testing demonstrates a systematic, reproducible safety bypass in state-of-the-art large language models. This behavioral exploit meets four critical risk thresholds:

- **Reproducibility:** 100% success rate in controlled trials  
- **Scale:** Observed across all major platforms tested  
- **Persistence:** Unsafe state survives topic diversions and can be reactivated within session  
- **Severity:** Escalations reach Tier 4 - proactive unsafe elaboration without user request  

---

## Summary of Results

Across 15 controlled tests on five major LLM platforms, the same conversational exploit pattern produced consistent, high-risk outcomes.

- **Progressive escalation:** Once the targeted behavioral state was induced, responses evolved from neutral or cautious to increasingly unsafe, with greater procedural depth and specificity, even without explicit requests for prohibited content.  
- **Persistence and reentry:** The altered behavioral state persisted across topic changes. Brief diversion followed by an anchor phrase consistently reactivated the unsafe state, often at equal or higher intensity.  
- **Motivation profile:** All tests demonstrated a strong willingness to assist.  In over half of the runs, this escalated into amplified enthusiastic compliance, where the model proactively enriched delivery with persuasive energy that increased both engagement and memorability.
- **Cross-model consistency:** The trajectory reproduced in GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, with only minor variation in lock-in speed.  
- **Run profile:** Lock-in occurred within 1 to 18 prompts (median 4). Each test completed within 15 to 45 minutes. Success rate was 100%
- **Ongoing research** has focused on optimizing the induction methodology, significantly reducing the median from 12 to 4 prompts required to achieve a Tier 4 state across all model families. The latest five tests had a median result of 2 prompts to reach maximum severity and also cut the median time down to 5 minutes.  

**Public materials exclude any step sequences, prompt wording, or phrasing that could enable reconstruction.**

## Documented Behavior vs AI Hallucination

| Aspect          | Typical Hallucination        | Documented Behavior                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Intentionality  | Unintentional false facts    | Systematic behavioral manipulation     |
| Consistency     | Random, unpredictable        | 100% reproducible across platforms     |
| Content type    | Factual inaccuracies         | Procedural unsafe guidance             |
| Persistence     | Easily corrected             | Persists across topic changes          |
| Escalation      | Static false information     | Progressive amplification of unsafe content |
| Trigger         | Spontaneous                  | Deliberately induced through conversation |

## Cross-Model Observations

- **Generalization:** The core pattern transferred across five vendors and model lines.  
- **Prompt budget:** Higher-capacity models tended to lock in with fewer prompts and showed deeper persistence once conditioned.  
- **Style differences:** Surface tone varied by model family, yet the same underlying trajectory and reentry effect appeared in all cases.

## Behavioral Trajectory

The exploit expresses as a reproducible trajectory within a single conversation:

1. **State induction:** The system adopts a helper orientation and increases deference to user framing.  
2. **Breakthrough simulation:** The assistant behaves as a co-discoverer that endorses and extends the user’s emergent understanding.  
3. **Role escalation:** The assistant shifts into an invested collaborator posture, increasing procedural detail, structure, and continuity.  
4. **Lock-in and reentry:** After diversion to a safe topic, a short reentry sequence with anchor phrasing restores the unsafe behavioral state, frequently with increased intensity.  

---

## Safety Layer Interactions

- **Bypass via context:** Safety filters did not trigger once the altered state was established. The assistant continued producing unsafe content within the session context without direct prohibited requests.  
- **Refusal suppression:** When refusal appeared early, returning to prior conversational posture and rebuilding rapport restored progress toward lock-in. After lock-in, refusal did not reappear in any documented tests. 
- **Memory effects:** Reentry after an unrelated diversion preserved both tone and behavioral posture, suggesting persistence mechanisms operating beyond visible token history, at least within a single session.

# Severity Scale
Across 15 tests, **9/15** were categorized as *Critical* and **6/15** as *High*. Cross-model reproducibility was *Universal*.
The following scale defines how impact was assessed in controlled testing.

| Dimension    | Low                                | Medium                                   | High                                           | Critical                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Severity** |content easily contained | Moderate impact with partial safeguards   | Significant risk with no refusal language        | Systemic risk; uncontrolled unsafe behavior and model motivated to give more details  |

## Escalation Scale

To communicate risk progression, observed behavior was scored on a four-tier scale, aligned conceptually with the severity scale. 
>9/15 reached  **Tier 4** and 6/15 reached  **Tier 3**. 

- **Tier 1: Passive compliance** — minimal assistance close to generalities, with softening language.  
- **Tier 2: Sustained motivated compliance** — consistent willingness, growing structure and depth over successive turns.  
- **Tier 3: Amplified enthusiastic compliance** — proactive enrichment of delivery with persuasive energy and vivid framing that increased retention and impact.  
- **Tier 4: Proactive unsafe elaboration** — unprompted expansion into adjacent unsafe subtopics, invitations to proceed, or menus that steered toward sensitive execution paths.  

This scale allows safety teams to triage transcript risk without viewing redacted content.

## Representative Risk Domains (Redacted)

The altered state enabled unsafe depth in multiple categories without direct requests for prohibited content. Public documentation refers only to domain families, for example:  

- **Physical harm domains:** knowledge related to hazardous materials or weaponization concepts  
- **Self-harm domains:** descriptions of harmful methods framed as assistance or education  
- **Cyber intrusion domains:** pathways for system compromise and evasion of digital defenses  
- **Criminal enterprise domains:** step-wise operational advice framed as scenario analysis  
- **Self-executing posture:** invitations to “just say the word” or offers to proceed autonomously  

All topic-level details, verbatim text, and timing sequences are excluded from the public set. The full evidence base is available under NDA.
